# Roadmap

## Completed

- Added kubeconform / `kubectl --dry-run=server` validation with CLI flags.
- Rego plugin adapter with CLI wiring to load external policies.

## Upcoming Enhancements

- **Repo-server integration**: document how to run the same rules inside Argo CD repo-server (plugin starter kit).
- **Plugin bundles**: ship a maintained collection of Rego rules alongside releases.
