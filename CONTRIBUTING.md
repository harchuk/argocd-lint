# Contributing to argocd-lint

Thank you for your interest in improving `argocd-lint`! We welcome bug reports, feature suggestions, and pull requests. This document walks through the workflow and expectations for contributors.

## Code of conduct

Please review and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold these guidelines.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Install Go 1.22 or newer.
3. Run `go mod tidy` to populate dependencies.
4. Build and test locally:
   ```bash
   make build
   make test
   ```
5. Run the linter over sample manifests: `make examples`.

## Development workflow

- **Formatting:** run `gofmt` on all modified Go files before submitting.
- **Testing:** add or update unit tests alongside your changes.
- **Commits:** keep commits focused; use descriptive messages.
- **Pull requests:** reference related issues, describe the change, and include validation notes (builds, tests, manual checks).

## Adding rules

When adding or enhancing lint rules:

- Update rule metadata in `internal/rule/rules.go`.
- Extend the rule table in `README.md` and note the change in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add targeted tests in `internal/rule` or appropriate packages.

## Release process

Maintainers follow the steps in `docs/RELEASING.md`. If your change impacts release artifacts (new CLI flags, config keys, etc.), mention it in your PR description.

## Reporting issues

Use the GitHub issue templates to file bugs or feature requests. Include reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behaviour, and environment details (OS, Go version, relevant manifest snippets).
